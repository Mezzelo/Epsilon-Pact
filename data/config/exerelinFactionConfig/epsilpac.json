	# for folks looking in here for a run-down on diplo relations
	# tl;dr: anti-hierarchical, egalitarian, anti-capitalist, NOT techpilled.  leadership has accelerationist aims - thus, the automated shenanigans
	# while most who adhere their philosophy advocate a kinder approach, the head of state is more willing to let it burn.
	
	# seemingly contradictory, but prefers to maintain an external status quo for multiple reasons: 
	# - foments internal dissatisfation, conducive to accelerationism
	# - give time for their own polity to consolidate/strengthen
	# - believes the sector's militarized stalemate is better equipped against external threats, i.e. omega, possible domain incursion, anime
	
	# hence anti-diplo:  though altruistic on a smaller scale, largely untrusting & occupied with their own machinations.  recognizes the sector as-is cannot last, and opposing powers are weaker for it.
	# re anti-hierarchical: nominally democratic & power structures are looser, but we all know who really holds the reins here - until the sector is a safer place, anyhow.
	# not necessarily technocratic, but their progressive disposition aligns them slightly with tech-forwards factions
	# more ideological/spiritual than one might expect - many agreeances with luddic philosophy, even, if not for AI personhood.  establishing a minimum standard of living means plainer lives for many (luxury commodities banned), especially with the state of the sector as-is.
