epsilpac,FACTION,"Appearing quite suddenly only a few cycles after the second AI war, the Epsilon Pact's obscure origins are the subject of rife speculation. A pair of tenets, one more controversial than the other, tie together their rather disparate demographics: Equal rights and living standards for all sapient life, and the Pact administration's insistence on the inclusion of AI cores in their definition of ""living"". The latter stance is taken with anything from begrudging acceptance to ardent pride amongst the citizenry, eccentric ideals and the sector's eternal ire a small price to pay for what they see as a fairer society.

Relations with the rest of the sector tend to be strained at the best of times, owing to the Pact's extremist stances on AI. Even those who would put AI cores to use are slighted for their supposed humanitarian violations against distinctly non-human entities. Though small, inscrutable, and mercurial as a polity, their outsized industrial and technological capacity is well-recognized and often sought after, diplomatically or otherwise.

As a loose federation with no real binding agreements, planetary governments vary in policy but often defer judgment to the Pact navy's admiral for security reasons. The spacefaring de-facto head of state has thus far maintained popular support, despite (or perhaps because of) their sordid past as a mercenary commander and guerilla.",,,,

espc_flagbearer,SHIP,"Otherwise underwhelming in every other regard, the tiny hull and outwardly low-tech specifications of this frigate belie its true potential. Its networked flux distributor allows it to bolster allies and strain enemies, making for a powerful support frigate able to punch far above its weight.

All technical concessions are made for the sake of optimizing flux throughput, augmenting use of the Gauss-Oni continuity drive. Great care must be taken during ship maintenance to avoid upsetting the highly sophisticated, yet brutally eloquent assembly running its myriad systems. The disproportionately large logistical profile of the Flagbearer is otherwise justified by its raw tactical utility and versatility, acting as a potent force multiplier under the right command.","Otherwise underwhelming in every other regard, the tiny hull and outwardly low-tech specifications of this frigate belie its true potential.

espc_rondel,SHIP,"Although somewhat sparsely armed, the Rondel is engineered to bring extraordinary amounts of firepower to bear in an instant. Most that face one down on the field learn quickly not to underestimate its seemingly scant armament.

Unusually fast for a shielded frigate, many compromises have been made in favor of its raw offensive performance. Complaints of ammunition belts lining its cramped corridors are common among novice crewmembers, but generally cease after one observes how quickly they deplete in combat.

Such a potent combination of low-tech speed and firepower comes with an inflated logistical footprint relative to its visible armament, leaving the Rondel rather unappealing compared to similar designs. The presence of this ship in a fleet suggests of a commander that understands its worth well, and justifies the fear many hold of its unassuming profile.","Although somewhat sparsely armed, the Rondel is engineered to bring extraordinary amounts of firepower to bear in an instant.

Crew that serve on Jackalope-class hulls are trained and outfitted to withstand heavy jerk generated by weapons fire, utilizing magboots and generously situated safety harnesses. Though a dreaded assignment for some, others are content to put up with its stomach-churning maneuvers, simply for the hull's reputation - after all, being on the receiving end of its fire is no more appealing for its would-be targets.","Taking after a certain ill-conceived pirate design, the Jackalope's main armament is almost comically large compared to the ship itself.

As its capacitors strain themselves against a target, the Songbird generates a long, audible droning noise over the duration of its system. This less-than-dulcet tone has gained an infamous reputation as a death knell for hulls of all sizes, an unsettling portent of often unmanageable incoming fire. Though its call is feared, the ship itself is only modestly armed for its cost, relying on its fleet to provide the bulk of firepower.

Although Pact engineers are keen to avoid high-tech for the sake of high-tech, often embracing moded and venerable principles, the Songbird stands as a shining pinnacle of their technological prowess.","The Songbird is a potent attack frigate, equipped with strong engines and a robust power core.

An uncommon combination of a potent shield emitter belies and durable armor plating allows it to take on large amounts of fire, whilst presenting enough of a threat to still mandate attention from its targets.

Concessions have been made flux-wise in order to accommodate for these defensive qualities, sacrificing the efficacy of its specialized competitors for the sake of survivability. An intrepid captain could find surprising mileage in its exotic system, particularly when utilized offensively - if prepared to pay for it. The constant overloads and subsequent reliance on armor plating makes for a veritable nightmare of post-combat maintenance, mandating healthy bonuses for any crew willing to serve on this class of hull.","The Opossum is small and nimble, but surprisingly resilient for its size.

Though it sports unusually robust flux characteristics, it's still a tanker, unwieldy and lacking in meaningful defensive options - aside from its offense.

Closer inspection reveals the Ember to be almost entirely designed around the union of its heavy armament and plentiful fuel reserves. Engineering tolerances are strict and internals are packed tightly as physically possible, enabling the ship to mount a single oversized weapon at the exclusion of the smaller auxiliary mounts one might expect to find.

The volume and weight of the Ember's fuel nacelles leave the ship rather clumsy in terms of maneuvering, creating a noticeable blindspot in its otherwise omni-directional turret coverage. The ships that would normally exploit this, however, tend to fare poorly in the face of its singularly-focused firepower.","An odd combination of tanker and combat vessel, the Ember's singular oversized mount is a threatening proposition for larger aggressors.

The Militia sports a solid combination of excellent logistical capabilities alongside respectable armament and combat endurance.

A hardy all-in-one combination, the Militia's initial sales pitch of ""economical"" hybridized transport was doomed from the beginning under the Domain's prosperous rule. It was rather fitting for the design to be saved only by the collapse of everything around it, gaining a new lease on life with the Pact's rediscovery and rejuvenation of its long-abandoned schematics.

Speaking to engineers tasked with the enviable task of maintaining this class of hull, one might surmise it was designed for war. This thought is fed in no small part by the very limited run of civilian models, and the subsequent unfortunate disappearance of original production chips only a few cycles after manufacturing first began.","What once began life as an armed civilian liner billed with the modest goal of safe travel, quickly shed the trappings of civility for the sake of its more specialized siblings.

An asymmetric, elongated structure allows the mounting and firing of heavy weaponry at extreme range, discouraging barbs through the phalanx of its forward allies. A crowning large mount poses a heavy threat to the fastest and bulkiest of ships.

Much like the polearms of those ancient ages, this contemporary counterpart share many of the same weaknesses - unwieldiness up close and a certain demise uncovered.  For this reason it is loved and loathed in equal measure, by the rare officer who manages to acquire one and the crewmember whose safety becomes dependent on their restless entourage.","The Billhook, much like its ancient namesake, sees fit to delegate all responsibilities besides its own firepower to other ships.

Underlying systems allow it to feed munitions quickly in the heat of battle. Paired with a main armament independent of the ship's flux reserves, the Narthex is more than capable of striking hard against targets far larger than itself.

A common-pattern shield generator and relatively sparse mountings help lower production costs, but also leave the ship vulnerable when exhausted of its main battery.

A centrally-positioned major flux conduit beneath the main armament creates unique interactions with its shield emitter. This allows the Observer to absorb large amounts of damage over time, while still generating enough power to strike back with surprising fervor.

Somewhat thin armor-plating and surprisingly modest flux characteristics leave the Observer vulnerable when truly overwhelmed, a common critique exacerbated by a relative lack of alternative defensive options. Lone-wolf captains are thus a rarity for this class of hull, although its robust power core and numerous mounts are not to be underestimated in the hands of an ambitious crew.","The Immolate is clearly derived from welding two Ember-class tankers together.

The majority of the Immolate's constituent hulls remain relatively intact, with their former cargo holds inverted to make room for additional fighter bays.

Its exceptional offensive capability is tempered only by the awkward alignment of its poorly defended broadside layout, demanding skillful and aggressive piloting to overcome.

The Chorale possesses a nigh-unmatched combination of speed and firepower for its class. When outfitted and piloted properly (both easier said than done), it is capable of outgunning battlecruisers whilst handily outmaneuvering their larger cousins. Said strengths come with significant drawbacks: Fitting such heavy firepower into a compact hull has resulted in awkward firing angles and esoteric mounting requirements, with little left in the way of defense.

Newer pilots invariably struggle to align their weapons whilst simultaneously protecting the ship's vulnerable starboard, often sending terrifying amounts of weapons fire flying right past their targets. For this reason, most fleets eventually end up scuttling salvaged instances of this hull.","Boasting heavy ordnance and excellent flux throughput, the Chorale competes with hulls twice its size in terms of raw firepower.

espc_gallant,SHIP,"An unprecedented combination of raw speed and firepower, the Serenade competes with both the quickest and the brawniest of its class. Though cumbersome maneuverability and a strict broadside configuration can leave its aft and prow vulnerable, few hulls can confidently keep up with the blistering pace of this imposing battleship.

Though in some ways inspired by Domain-era doctrine, the Serenade more closely follows after the ancient naval ship of the line, pummeling passing targets in brief and brutal broadside confrontations. The thought of taking re-purposing the doctrine of wooden hulls for spacefaring combat seems ludicrous - and perhaps that was what motivated Pact engineers to explore this untread territory.

The Serenade's thrust is concentrated almost entirely forwards through a massive main nacelle, making turning a convoluted affair at the best of times, let alone during full burn. In exchange, this grants it exceptional sustained speed for a ship so well armed. Few other ships are able to burn across the battlefield and deliver torpedo-strength salvos, although none find it as difficult to train their guns on their targets.

The Serenade serves a vital role as the Epsilon navy's largest and strongest fleet anchor, albeit an unusually mobile one.

Originally intended for use as shield-breaking artillery on planetary batteries, the Type XII provides astonishing damage output capable of crippling capital-scale shielding in mere seconds. The XII-a compact variant retains the original's short-term firepower, at the expense of equally crippling flux generation for the firing ship.

Without the requisite auxiliary systems the original design relies on, the Type XII-a suffers from horrid inefficiency and limited feed throughput. Larger hulls struggle to dissipate excess flux, and smaller hulls lack the capacity to utilize its firepower without endangering themselves. In the right place and time, however, the raw damage potential it brings to bear is near unmatched.",,,,
espc_gatling,WEAPON,"The Heavy Gatling's initial damage output is anemic, but slowly ramps up into a hail of fire capable of shredding armor through sheer volume alone.

An unorthodox recontextualization of ancient mechanical fundamentals, the Heavy Gatling's sheer volume of fire is nigh-unmatched. Though hit strength is unexceptional, their frequency is anything but. Lighter hulls are particularly subsceptible to its barrage, an overbearing obstacle for opposing fighters.

The dependence of the cylical action on its recoil, rather than an external mechanism, results in an initially sluggish firing rate that ramps up over time. However, its self-motivated operation results in excellent efficiency, allowing it to exert surprising shield pressure.",,,,
espc_flak,WEAPON,"Fires a highly inaccurate spread of fast-travelling oversized flechette. Shots home in on PD threats, doubling as novel long-ranged active defense.

The Scatter Rifle is eccentric on its barest principles, combining a long functional range with terrible accuracy and mediocre hit strength. Inaccuracy is severe to the point of shooting wide of even cruisers. Paradoxically, however, it is developed for effectiveness specifically against the smallest of targets.

Using dynamic mechanical rifling, the Scatter Rifle can precisely and instantaneously divert its flechette rounds towards incoming fighters and missiles. A single shot is capable of disabling an entire fighter wing from much further than most point defense, often before bombers can even launch their payloads. Spalling inflicted on fighter-grade plating makes it particularly devastating against wings, although performance suffers greatly anything larger targets for it.",,,,

espc_montante,WEAPON,"This novel, versatile weapon varies in behaviour depending on its mount type: Either slashing defensively as PD, or concentrated in vicious piercing offense.

Operation is, in most aspects, deceptively simple compared to similarly potent beam weapons. The Montante is instead distinguished by its super-heated gain medium, derived from the excitation of a bismuth sample - the particularly volatile nature of the medium results in a stream conducive to extreme charges, with heavy ionic and radioactive properties.

The beam's instability allows it to operate with radically varying effects: It can be swept to create a destructive arc vaporizing matter in its path, or concentrated to create intense shield-piercing electromagnetic rebounds.

The weapon's variable operation, an often frustrating and inconvenient ""feature"", likely owes itself to manufacturing constraints. Even cutting-edge nanoforges often fall short of the precision required to ensure consistent operation, an issue only exacerbated by its rare and fickle bismuth isotope. For this reason, the sector at large is content to leave the Montate a novelty - although few would turn their nose to an acquisition.",,,,

espc_amflamer,WEAPON,"Draws from the ship's AM fuel reserves to fire a stream of superheated plasma, scorching targets and melting nearby fighters and missiles. Usage consumes CR, rendering the weapon unable to operate once depleted.

Although simple in concept, the AM Flamer is deceptively complex operationally. Creating a (relatively) controlled, high-energy stream from the initially inert fullerene form-factor of AM fuel requires considerable energy expenditure, though only trivial quantities are actually necessary to catalyze the reaction.

The AM Flamer was designed in tandem with the Ember-class tanker, whose ship system bolsters its impact significantly. Though surprisingly easy to decouple, doing so for use on other hulls is thoroughly inadvisable, as other ships lack the Ember's bespoke feed and auxiliary mechanisms.

Although the AM Flamer uses relatively small quantities of fuel relative to the amount required for hyperspace travel, operation is extremely strenuous on the weapon and the ship itself. System degradation is expected, and thus crew are encouraged to focus primarily on defensive doctrine.

Mounting the AM Flamer independently of its original hull involves precariously linking up the weapon directly to the fuel reserves of whatever ship intends to use it. Resulting performance is even less efficient in terms of flux generation, and prone to malfunctions. ",,,,

Rapid reciprocation does not allow the mechanism to fully reset, reducing the efficiency of weapons with an already larger volume of fire.",Offensive,"Instantly maxes out ship flux with weapon fire when a ballistic from the selected group is fired, causing an immediate overload. Low flux-per-shot weapons incur an additional flux cost, reducing their effectiveness.",,
espc_Harmonizer,SHIP_SYSTEM,"The Hybrid Harmonizer utilizes a unique asymmetrical flux routing structure to boost the performance of large weapon slots. Ballistic and energy weapons create slightly different, but generalized entropic signatures; traditionally ignored, a complex system integrated into the hull allows its flux distribution to take advantage of their signatures to greatly optimize the flux generation and cyclic rate of weaponry.
