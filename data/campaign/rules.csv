""We've been tracking a fleet of domain-era drones in the $bcb_systemName, $bcb_dist light-years from here.""

""Did you catch that?"" She raises an eyebrow. ""An active fleet. Typically, they require our aid to rise from their dormant state. This fleet caught us off-guard - they don't do this on their own, and it's refused any communication on our end."" Her hand hovers over a different, redder file for a brief, tantalizing moment, before she dismisses it from her feed. 

""We've our suspicions,"" she says, shaking her head, ""but the fact remains that whatever their intentions, this fleet is a threat to unaligned parties. Our operations are done in a defensive capacity only - we understand the threat posed here, and there's only one thing to be done about it. We're offering a bounty of $bcb_reward credits - for your cooperation and your silence.""

Not a usual target on our end - they're generally receptive to our interests, but.."" Her eyes narrow as she expands an image of the fleet in question. ""In the $bcb_systemName, $bcb_dist light-years from here. Something's off.""

""Generally, these fleets keep to their own systems. A good thing, as far as we're concerned - the onus remains on those who overstep their bounds."" She leans closer, scanning the briefing over again as though she'd missed something. ""This one's acting up, in a way we can't condone. Too many innocents in the crossfire.""

You note her mouthing something to herself, before her attention returns back to you. ""..I'll reserve my suspicions for the moment - you're not here for that. $bcb_reward credits, if you can eliminate this fleet within the next $bcb_days days.""",,

Isabelle stares you down, straight-faced - a sight you're not sure how to interpret. She pulls up a distant image of what appears to be a fleet of Remnant droneships. ""We've spotted this in the $bcb_systemName, $bcb_dist light-years from here.""

As she manipulates the image, you note a strange, almost violently angular ship in the center of the fleet formation. ""I've correlated this with testimony from our expeditionary forces and some HEGINT data."" She mentions the latter off-handedly, a detail she'd normally savour. ""Our purview normally involves things more sensitive than the average fare, but this is something more.""

She palms the image again, zooming in further. The ivory silhouette stretches with discordant detail, as though discomforting for the footage itself to display. ""..yes, this has to be it."" Another glance at the corner of her display - she moves a briefing to the top, but leaves it closed.

""We need this fleet eliminated. $bcb_reward credits - I won't pretend this will be easy for you. Far from it as you could imagine, we suspect, so you can expect generous compensation for your capabilities and your silence on the matter.
