This fleet caught us off-guard - they don't do this on their own, and it's refused any communication on our end."" Her hand hovers over a different, redder file for a brief, tantalizing moment, before she dismisses it from her feed.

""Our purview normally involves things more sensitive than the average fare, but this is.. something more than that.""

She palms the image again, zooming in further. The ivory silhouette stretches with discordant detail, as though the footage itself is struggling to display it. ""..yes, this has to be it."" Another glance at the corner of her screen - she moves a briefing to the top, but leaves it closed.
