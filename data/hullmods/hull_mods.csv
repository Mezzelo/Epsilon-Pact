Recoiling Frame,espc_recoilmod,,,,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.scripts.hullmods.espc_RecoilModBehaviour,"This ship's frame is unusually lightweight, absorbing disproportionately high amounts of weapons fire with backwards movement. High tolerances allow over-clocking undersized weapons if adequate armament is unavailable.

Propels the ship opposite to the direction of %s weapons fire, based on their damage output. If a %s weapon is mounted, increases ballistic rate of fire and ammo regeneration for all weapons by %s.

If %s is installed, reduces backwards propulsion from weapons fire by %s.","Propels the ship backwards when firing medium and large weapons, based on the damage output and direction of fire. Increases ballistic rate of fire and ammo regeneration by 50% if a medium weapon is mounted instead of a large. Backwards propulsion is reduced by 20% if using heavy armor.",graphics/hullmods/espc_recoilmodicon.png
Linked Mounting Assemblies,espc_serenademod,,,,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.scripts.hullmods.espc_SerenadeModBehaviour,"The Serenade's mountings are streamlined for loading opposite pairs, allowing it to support considerably more heavy weaponry than its low-tech power core might suggest.

Reduces the ordnance point cost of large weapons by %s and medium weapons by %s. Every symmetrical pair of weapons increases flux dissipation, by %s for large weapons and %s for medium weapons.","Reduces OP for large and medium weapons by 10/5, and increases flux dissipation by 100/50 for every symmetrical pair of large/medium weapons mounted.",graphics/hullmods/espc_serenademodicon.png
Hardpoint-Array Stabilizers,espc_choralemod,,,,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.scripts.hullmods.espc_ChoraleModBehaviour,"The Chorale's hardpoints are specialized for handling the sustained force of numerous heavy weapons against a relatively lightweight frame. This benefits shorter-ranged weapons, but doctrinal requirements limit the effectiveness of longer-ranged armaments.

Increases the range of non-PD medium/large weapons below %s base range by %s/%s, up to %s. Reduces top speed by %s su/second for every medium or large weapon with %s or more base range.","Increases the range of non-PD medium and large weapons below 800 base range by 200/100, up to 800.
