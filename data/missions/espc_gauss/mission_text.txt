The academies, the agencies, the sector's finest institutions; all filled to the brim with boot-sucking sycophants and spoiled ignoramuses.

For better or worse, you went, and they welcomed you with open arms and grins routinely too wide for comfort.

Despite their rough exteriors and collective dearth of brain-cells, they're still unscrupulous opportunists who know an asset when they see one. You finally saw your research funded, and even assisted by fellow engineers of varying competence and boundless enthusiasm.
