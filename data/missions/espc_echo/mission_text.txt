Location: A desolate system some ways west of the core worlds

Reasonable folks, at a glance. But right about now, you'd trade all the credits you've made from your lucrative business with them for a world in which they hadn't lost their screws.

It'd been a usual run for the most part, bartering cheap consumer electronics to the tribes in exchange for some of the highest quality artisan luxuries found across the sector. Enough dividends to invest in some exotic hulls as well; rare finds sure to bring a pretty penny from some over-budgeted commander, and port authorities tend to forget to check the cargo holds on fresh exports.

Would've been a quick hop back to the core, even through the pirates, until the drones came. Half your fleet and a hasty jump later, you've come to regret your choice of trade route.

Straight across the system lies an abandoned Phaeton-class tanker with enough fuel to get what remains of your fleet back home, and maybe somewhere a little less rotten while you're at it. It drifts along an asteroid ring, nestled between scattered rocks and the husks of her ill-fated fleet, on the other side of what must've been their untimely death.

It'll have been yours as well, if you don't get that fuel. Those Pact nut-jobs, for all their charity and goodwill, are still responsible for these abominations and beholden to their damnable lack of discretion. The system's grave-keepers stare you down as you approach. The solemn silhouettes of their errant platings grow in your view, discernible only by the faint outline of a dying star.

As you burn your fleet forwards, you do not avert your gaze.
