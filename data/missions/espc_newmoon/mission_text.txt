Accounts of Nola Ganymede's death were apparently exaggerated, although not by much. It had to have come pretty close that day, considering how many limbs she'd left behind.

Wherever her motives truly lie, she's still quite clearly a spacer captain at heart before anything else - more than evident from her rejuvenated fleet's audacious assault on Filkenhild's orbital station. The spoils of their sudden raid? A single Lasher-class frigate.

The chaos, alarms and evacuations are cut unceremoniously short. Head-counts and inventory checks all but confirm the comically underwhelming loss (singular) of the invasion, gone as quickly as it had appeared. Many a bewildered stare is exchanged beneath the station's blaring ochre emergency lights.

Local command, somewhat flummoxed but mostly vengeful, quickly sends notice to Kazeron. Nola Ganymede, an infamous terrorist thought to be dead for the last half-decade, has suddenly materialized in the middle of the Westernesse star system and raided a Persean League orbital station. For a low-tech frigate. The thought is almost as troubling as it is insulting to the navarchs. Her confusing, bloody legacy is to end here and now, before she can escape into the stars again.

The League's rapid reprisal waits outside the system, boasting more than enough firepower to crush an opposition far larger than the one they expect. On the other side of their jump point, a once-estranged captain prepares to command her motley fleet as she finally returns home.
