Tri-Tach knew. They always know. Their eyes and ears are everywhere, and for a time, you were their in.

A disgraced commander thought to be dead and a couple hundred desperate refugees - these types tend to resurface several times a cycle only to meet some unremarkable demise, but they're worth keeping tabs on nevertheless. Those in your station are often given busywork like this between assignments, to punctuate the dead air. It's good practice to keep an eye on all things, big and small. Who knows what could come of it, what spoils await the astute and responsible associate?

Nothing, typically. But this time, it was different.

The colonies were, in all honestly, nothing to behold. Decrepit and ramshackle, they survived on little more than strenuous labor and force of will. And yet you remained, as did they against the harshest of odds, braving the unforgiving frontier they'd come to call home.

It was inevitable that you'd eventually be made, but this time you chose not to disappear. More intoxicating than any amount of credits, you were offered the chance to fight for something different.

Your handler, observant as ever, has taken notice of your lack of contributions to the Strategic Predictor's database on his behalf. On your way to this cycle's rendezvous, you detect their signatures a few light-years out - a commandeered heavy patrol fleet on an intercept route, ready to pounce and put a swift end to your charade. Some questions are raised over the unknown design you've arrived in, rather than the top-of-the-line Aurora alloted to your station, but all concerns are quickly dismissed. What chance could a lone cruiser stand, outnumbered five to one against their cutting-edge fleet?

This should wrap things up nicely.
