The looming AI presence across the sector becomes harder to hide every passing cycle. Tri-Tachyon grows stronger by the day, yet the corporation remains haunted by the ghosts of its failed wars. Technological reclamation fleets venture to the furthest reaches of the sector, seeking to recover the spoils of an era long gone in pursuit of their lost legacy.

Although Artemisia's bold vision looks towards the future, there is still much to be learned from the past.

The meandering, decrepit spectres of Tri-Tachyon's former exploits are thankfully benign, wandering aimlessly in search of directives never given. Still, company protocol mandates that distance be maintained. The expedition director is more than happy to comply. There's just something ominous about those old derelicts, an unspeakable malaise left unassuaged by the calm front his superiors put on.

Systems with active beacons tend to be filled with tech too dangerous for independents and too expensive for the other factions to bother with, and thus tend to be ripe and bountiful with untouched caches. However, something has changed in recent times. Pickings have grown sparser. The prospect of competition seems incongruent with the local drone presence, yet the scarcity of returns is impossible to ignore - especially in the face of an impending performance review.

The expedition has just decided to continue salvage efforts in hopes of meeting their quota, when they spot an unknown signature. A stray fleet has wandered into the system, transponders off and warning beacon ignored - scavengers overstepping their bounds, soon to pay a grim toll to these old ships gone astray. That is the initial assumption, at least, but the conclusion does not follow. To the director's growing horror, the scavengers and droneships instead fold into formation, slowly approaching in uncanny unison.
