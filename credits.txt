All of the art, code, design, writing, and sound in this mod is made by Mezzelo or is derived from the vanilla game or its open-licensed community libraries, with the following exceptions:

- Faction music is taken from cuts of Patricia Taxxon's album Aeroplane - specifically, from the songs Scruff and Aeroplane. Consider checking out her discography, my amateur edits do her work no justice.
