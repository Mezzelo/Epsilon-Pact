- Reduced flux capacity threshold at which AI activates system from 80% to 70%

Hybrid Harmonizer

World-gen changes (non-random sector):
- Star systems (Khemsala & Tocquiera) shifted south and slightly west to resolve conflicts with Kemet/The Crown Constellation
- Lunron Saba and Bruniel given the the AI Sub-Population planetary condition, which permutates into Rogue AI Population if conquered via Nexerelin.  Consider saturation bombardment.
Lunron Saba
- Heavy Batteries added, replacing Ground Defenses
- Heavy Industry moved here, from Bruniel
Bruniel
- Light Industry moved here, from Lunron Saba
Falris
- Heavy Batteries added, replacing Ground Defenses
Tocquiera
- Heavy Batteries removed, instead spawns with a unique structure that reflects lore
- Dealmaker Holosuite removed
- Administrator given a unique skill
    - If using Nexerelin, unique administrator leaves colony if Tocquiera is conquered, and returns only if Pact regains control
- Officers in Pact fleets have access to a unique set of skills alongside the vanilla ones, and utilize a selection algorithm based on hull type.
    - Pact bounty fleets now use their regular skill selection as opposed to before, where it was genericized.
    - Officers in missions reworked to incorporate new skills
- Officers (including mercenary officers) that spawn on Pact markets always use these skills.

- Nexus contruction feature disabled.
- All Derelict (EP) hulls now use proper derelict loadouts - except the sentry (EP) with hammers, that keeps missile autoloader cos it's funny.
- Autofit chance in Pact doctrine lowered from 0.1 > 0
- Reputation gain from turning in AI cores capped, both with faction & the contacts you turn cores over to.
- Reputation cost for purchasing blueprints roughly halved across the board.
- When purchasing blueprints, you are also given copies of their respective items: 2 of each weapon, 1 of each ship.
- Fissile Confluence Emitter removed as a purchasable blueprint - it uses no auto-fit tags, on account of being too fickle to build with.
- Personal reputation requirement required to gain Isabelle as a contact removed (or set to >-1, to be exact)

- All ship variants revised to account for balance changes to hulls & weapons, several altered for balance, some rather situational variants added/removed.
- Fissile Confluence Emitter added to the Pact blueprint package.
- Phased out some weapons from Pact markets & variants; most notably Railguns, Breach missiles and Hypervelocity Drivers.
- Sunder rarity in Pact 1.0 > 0.6, in line with other vanilla hulls; was previously left unset, oops.
- Hammerhead rarity in Pact 0.3 > 0.6
- Added single hammer/atropos/sabot to Pact markets.
- Nexerelin: Corporate leaning shifted from -0.5 to -1.0, diplomatic leaning shifted from 0.0 to -0.5

- Text revisions all over: typo fixes, proofreading & the like.
- Fixed null crash that occurred when Isabelle moves between markets, for some reason I'm still not sure of.
- Fixed a null crash when shield shunting the Observer (lol)
- other crash bugs idr fixed.
- Fixed duplicate markets that appear when markets are conquered.

Version 0.3.93-RC3
- fixed a crash when activating the Slamfire ship system without any weapons equipped.
thanks to NaitNait, again, for the report.
- added changelog to mod files for use with mod managers/other utils
- fixed mod thread ID to properly link to its forum page

- revisions to mission text for New Moon.

Version 0.3.93-RC2
- fixed a dialogue null pointer error when exiting from certain contacts at bad relations and using stellar networks - uses a more vanilla esque prompt to cut comms, rather than just booting you out now.
thanks to NaitNait for the report.

Version 0.3.93-RC1
- auto slugshot OP from 10 > 11.  that combination of hit strength and burst damage was a little too spicy for early game.
- auto slugshot and solo AM flamer rarity from 1 > 0.4, just forgot to set those oops
- jackalope (LP)'s DP from 5 > 7.  it was DEFINITELY too spicy for its cost.
- adjusted the price of the Observer (TT) and Pilgrim (H) down a bit.

- fixed the remise mortar & driver's design type to epsilon pact, rather than common
- revised some descriptions

- increased spawn rate of Pact-Derelict ships in derelict fleets from 20% to 30%.
- dp values revised: berserker (EP) from 11 > 10, bastillon (EP) from 10 > 8.  the relative doctrinal inflexibility and terrible flux stats of these ships proves a major weakness in a fleet setting.
- revised the berserker (EP) assault variant

- fixed a bug preventing the sentry (EP) from appearing in derelict fleets, and larger pact fleets.

Version 0.3.92-RC3
- minor portrait revisions
- fixed a bug causing crashes when using the Solo AM flamer on ships without systems.  thanks to everything bagle for the report

Version 0.3.92-RC2
- finnegan base damage buffed from 2000 > 2500. impact damage remains unchanged
- fixed a bug with the calculation of the finnegan's impact volume.  it is now louder, and funnier.

Version 0.3.92-RC1
- Sprite revisions to both AM Flamers and the Heavy Gatling
- Sprite revisions to a couple of portraits (espc_raul, espc_rosa)
- Proper hullmod icons for the Recoiling Frame and Hardpoint-Array Stabilizers built-in hullmods
- added normal maps for weapons
- fixed mis-aligned Type XII-a turret sprite
- added missing graphicslib light effects for the Auto-Scattershot and Auto-Slugshot

- Replaced placeholder sounds for the Rift Pike, Rift Spear, Fissile Confluence Emitter and Remise Mortar with slightly less placeholder sounds

- Rep gain/blueprint exchange rate for core trades readjusted: 3/5/8 with Isabelle, 4 with Gauss or administrators in Nex random worlds.
- Task force construction fleet interval increased from once every 3 months -> 4 months

- version checker properly implemented, oops.
- removed duplicate mission files
- removed duplicate ship albedos in normals folder

Version 0.3.91
- Fixed a dialogue error when caught smuggling that prevented usual dialogue options.
- Lowered reputation gain from repatriating Beta and Gamma cores. Subject to change, may make purchasing blueprints too tedious.
thanks to deageon for sniffing out those issues (and for other feedback)

Version 0.3.9
initial release.  not public, just release.  nobody else knew this existed except for a friend who doesn't care about this game.  i bear these burdens alone.
