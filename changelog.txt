Version 0.3.93-RC2
- fixed a dialogue null pointer error when exiting from certain contacts at bad relations and using stellar networks - uses a more vanilla esque prompt to cut comms, rather than just booting you out now.
thanks to NaitNait for the report.

Version 0.3.93-RC1
- auto slugshot OP from 10 > 11.  that combination of hit strength and burst damage was a little too spicy for early game.
- auto slugshot and solo AM flamer rarity from 1 > 0.4, just forgot to set those oops
- jackalope (LP)'s DP from 5 > 7.  it was DEFINITELY too spicy for its cost.
- adjusted the price of the Observer (TT) and Pilgrim (H) down a bit.

- fixed the remise mortar & driver's design type to epsilon pact, rather than common
- revised some descriptions

- increased spawn rate of Pact-Derelict ships in derelict fleets from 20% to 30%.
- dp values revised: berserker (EP) from 11 > 10, bastillon (EP) from 10 > 8.  the relative doctrinal inflexibility and terrible flux stats of these ships proves a major weakness in a fleet setting.
- revised the berserker (EP) assault variant

- fixed a bug preventing the sentry (EP) from appearing in derelict fleets, and larger pact fleets.

Version 0.3.92-RC3
- minor portrait revisions
- fixed a bug causing crashes when using the Solo AM flamer on ships without systems.  thanks to everything bagle for the report

Version 0.3.92-RC2
- finnegan base damage buffed from 2000 > 2500. impact damage remains unchanged
- fixed a bug with the calculation of the finnegan's impact volume.  it is now louder, and funnier.
- fixed a typo
- derelict tags added to derelict (EP) hulls, should spawn in derelict fleets now

Version 0.3.92-RC1
- Sprite revisions to both AM Flamers and the Heavy Gatling
- Sprite revisions to a couple of portraits (espc_raul, espc_rosa)
- Proper hullmod icons for the Recoiling Frame and Hardpoint-Array Stabilizers built-in hullmods
- added normal maps for weapons
- fixed mis-aligned Type XII-a turret sprite
- added missing graphicslib light effects for the Auto-Scattershot and Auto-Slugshot

- Replaced placeholder sounds for the Rift Pike, Rift Spear, Fissile Confluence Emitter and Remise Mortar with slightly less placeholder sounds

- Rep gain/blueprint exchange rate for core trades readjusted: 3/5/8 with Isabelle, 4 with Gauss or administrators in Nex random worlds.
- Task force construction fleet interval increased from once every 3 months -> 4 months

- version checker properly implemented, oops.
- removed duplicate mission files
- removed duplicate ship albedos in normals folder

Version 0.3.91
- Fixed a dialogue error when caught smuggling that prevented usual dialogue options.
- Lowered reputation gain from repatriating Beta and Gamma cores. Subject to change, may make purchasing blueprints too tedious.
thanks to deageon for sniffing out those issues (and for other feedback)

Version 0.3.9
