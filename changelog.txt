    - Pact bounty fleets now use their regular skill selection as opposed to before, where it was genericized.
    - Officers in missions reworked to incorporate new skills
- Officers (including mercenary officers) that spawn on Pact markets always use these skills.

- Nexus contruction feature disabled.
- Procedural Pact fleets will spawn at the end of slipstreams and outside/in Remnant systems.

- All Derelict (EP) hulls now use proper derelict loadouts - except the snety (EP) with hammers, that keeps missile autoloader cos it's funny.
- Picket (EP), Snety (EP), and Bastillon (EP) no longer use the NO_AUTOFIT tag and will appear in Derelict and Pact fleets with d-mods (and terrible loadouts) now.
- Variant randomization disabled completely for Pact fleets (including bounties and allied Nexerelin fleets for either faction), but fleets will now properly spawn with s-mods and d-mods where they were previously missing.
- Reputation gain from turning in AI cores capped, both with faction & the contacts you turn cores over to.
- You can no longer trade in modded AI cores.  Untested outcomes that might've behaved weird, might take a look at this later.
- Reputation cost for purchasing blueprints roughly halved across the board.
- When purchasing blueprints, you are also given copies of their respective items: 2 of each weapon, 1 of each ship.
- Fissile Confluence Emitter removed as a purchasable blueprint - it uses no auto-fit tags, on account of being too fickle to build with.
- Personal reputation requirement required to gain Isabelle as a contact removed (or set to >-1, to be exact)

	- Pact markets also sell fighter LPCs less frequently, and no longer sell remnant fighter LPCs.
- Sunder rarity in Pact 1.0 > 0.6, in line with other vanilla hulls; was previously left unset, oops.
- Hammerhead rarity in Pact 0.3 > 0.6
- Frequency of cross-faction skins lowered (~0.7 commonality to ~0.3 for most)
- You will lose a large amount of reputation with the faction each month if you own any of their (non-random sector) markets or you are using the Supercomputer industry from Industrial Evolution.
- You will permanently lose Isabelle as a contact if your rep falls below neutral, or after committing more than 1 atrocity.
	- Gauss will also refuse to speak to you if you commit any atrocities.

- Nexerelin: Corporate leaning shifted from -0.5 to -1.0, diplomatic leaning shifted from 0.0 to -0.5

- Fixed duplicate submarkets that appear when markets are conquered in Nex
- Text revisions all over: typo fixes, proofreading & the like.

thanks to NaitNait for the report.

Version 0.3.93-RC1

- fixed the remise mortar & driver's design type to epsilon pact, rather than common
- revised some descriptions

- increased spawn rate of Pact-Derelict ships in derelict fleets from 20% to 30%.
- dp values revised: berserker (EP) from 11 > 10, bastillon (EP) from 10 > 8.  the relative doctrinal inflexibility and terrible flux stats of these ships proves a major weakness in a fleet setting.
- revised the berserker (EP) assault variant

- fixed a bug preventing the sentry (EP) from appearing in derelict fleets, and larger pact fleets.

Version 0.3.92-RC3
- minor portrait revisions
- fixed a bug causing crashes when using the Solo AM flamer on ships without systems.  thanks to everything bagle for the report

- fixed mis-aligned Type XII-a turret sprite
- added missing graphicslib light effects for the Auto-Scattershot and Auto-Slugshot

- Rep gain/blueprint exchange rate for core trades readjusted: 3/5/8 with Isabelle, 4 with Gauss or administrators in Nex random worlds.
- Task force construction fleet interval increased from once every 3 months -> 4 months

- version checker properly implemented, oops.
- removed duplicate mission files
- removed duplicate ship albedos in normals folder

Version 0.3.91
- Fixed a dialogue error when caught smuggling that prevented usual dialogue options.
- Lowered reputation gain from repatriating Beta and Gamma cores. Subject to change, may make purchasing blueprints too tedious.
thanks to deageon for sniffing out those issues (and for other feedback)

Version 0.3.9
initial release.  not public, just release.  nobody else knew this existed except for a friend who doesn't care about this game.  i bear these burdens alone.
